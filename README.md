WEB SCRAPER

This Web Scraper project was developed as part of a coding bootcamp to practice working with Python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup. 
The goal of the project was to scrape a website listing the 100 Greatest Films, extract the movie titles, and save them to a .txt file.
This project showcases fundamental skills in web scraping, HTML parsing, and Python file I/O.
